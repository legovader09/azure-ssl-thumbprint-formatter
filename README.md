# Azure SSL Thumbprint formatter

Depending on your Azure IIS deployment setups, you may need to enter an SSL thumbprint without any spaces. Sometimes, the copying of the thumbprint can cause special hidden characters to appear on the starts end of the string. This app strips the special characters and gets rid of the whitespace to save time on manually parsing for hidden characters, and removing the whitespace.
